# Estimated Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian Model

The *EHANK.jl* package solves the one-asset HANK model using the solution methods from ["When Inequality Matters for Macro and Macro Matters for Inequality"](https://princeton.edu/~moll/WIMM.pdf) by Ahn et al. (2017).

The MATLAB code, which produced the original results that this package seeks to replicate,
is located in Greg Kaplan's [phact](https://github.com/gregkaplan/phact/) repository.

Finally, a step by step document that details each of the components of the model solution
is located on Sehyoun Ahn's website [here](https://sehyoun.com/EXAMPLE_one_asset_HANK_web.html).
